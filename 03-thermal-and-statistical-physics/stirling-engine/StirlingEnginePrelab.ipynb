    "If the working fluid (air) of the system starts at room pressure $p_{room}$, maximum volume $V_{max}$ and temperature $T_{cold}$ what is the number of moles $n$ ? (Hint: the molar gas constant is $R$.)\n",

    "2. The maximum volume of the working fluid, when the working piston is fully pushed out.\n",
    "3. The local room pressure, which we will assume to be the pressure of the working fluid (air) when cold and at maximum volume inside the Stirling engine cyliner.\n",
    "4. The elevation of Denver in meters (needed to provide pressure corrections).\n",

Click on the map where you are located and find the barometric pressure in the resulting display. The problem is that the reported pressure is adjusted to sea-level equivalent using a model for the altitude dependence. This adjustment must be undone in the code below to estimate the actual room pressure. *To make this correction, you will also need to find the altitude $h$ of your location.*\n",
    "2. *(Later in the lab)* Manually turn the flywheel until the working piston is at the bottom to give maximum volume and the displacement piston is raised so that most of the air is in the cold region of the cylinder. We will call this point \"c\" in the cycle. Directly measure the pressure using the sensor system and compare this to the value that you looked up, adjusted for altitude in the python code."

Along the way, we will introduce and explore the operation of an important element called the regenerators. The main idea is that a 100% regenerator is capable of absorbing all of the change in thermal energy of the gas when it goes from point b to point c (constant volume cooling) and then gives all of this stored thermal energy back in  going from point d to a (constant volume heating). A 60% effective regenerator only absorbs and restores 60% of the change in thermal energy with the remaining thermal energy being lost to the cooling bath, reducing the overall efficiency. A 0% effective regenerator means that all of the change in thermal energy must be dumped into the bath in going from b to c and thus none is recovered in going from d back to a.\n",
